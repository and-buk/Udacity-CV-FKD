# Project: Facial Keypoint Detection

This repository contains a solution for the first project of [**Computer Vision Nanodegree program**](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891).

In this project we'll combine knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.

### Instructions
